<br>
This was a geniunely enjoyable physics phone game project to do as I took care of creating some assets in the game. The most challenging part of this project was finding the core mechanic for this game. 


<br>
I was initially thinking of doing a player controller which allowed you to change states (from solid to liquid to gas). However, I realised that I had little knowledge on creating fluid shaders and that designing levels for such a complex mechanic would be too difficult.


<br>
After experiencing some phone games (like Angry Birds), I have learnt that the main mechanic of a game does not need to be complex. It can be simple but yet create a complex puzzle.

## Description
***
<br>
A small python macro program which I have made to learn Python after graduating from polytechnic.

<br>
This program allows for recording of keyboard and mouse commands as well as some windows functions like moving or deletion of certain types of files. 

<br>
<br>




## Features
----
<br>
- Record keystrokes or mouseclicks
- Threading
- Command Pattern for Do & Undoing tasks

<br>

## Reflection
----
<br>

**Language Used:**
Python

<br>
This is a python macro program created after I graduated. Initially I coded this software to collect my game's daily gifts due to the repetitive nature of the action. 

<br>

However, as I develop an interest in video editing, I realised that this program could also be used for auto subtitling by coding an input for the macro to be repeated a number of times defined by user input.

<br>

This made my life a lot easier as I no longer need to do the manual action of copying and pasting text into a video

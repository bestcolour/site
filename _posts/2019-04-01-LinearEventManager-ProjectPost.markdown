<br>
Hangry Guardians is my first 2D mobile game client project I have ever done in my life. I worked together with 7 other people in my Polytechnic class to accomplish this game for the client, GameStartAsia.

<br>

One of the most challenging aspect of this project was to provide information to the player about the rules of the game as there seems to be a lot of things happening on the screen. I designed the tutorial to hide certain UI elements in the early levels of each map.

<br>

This allows me to slowly introduce the mechanics without overwhelming the player. This led to an idea for [Linear Effect Manager]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/polytechnic-games/haulaway-post) which allows me to sequence events in order to make Tutorial making a lot easier.

<br>

Other notable things I have done are the visual effects which give the players feedback whenever they are doing something positive or negative.

## Description
***
<br>
Space Runners is a competitive 3D platformer multiplayer networking game which can have up to 6 players playing at one time. The host player takes the role of a space overlord while the others take the role of space runners.

<br>

The overlord's goal is to destroy every runner using its laser ability which temporarily disables tiles while the runners' goal is to collect x number of objectives by parkouring around the map before all of them fall into the void below.

## Reflection
----
<br>
**Language Used:**
C#

**Software Used:**
Unity Game Engine

**Roles:**
Matchmaking Lobby, UI & UX Design

<br>
Space Runners is my first multiplayer networking project and there were definitely challenges that I have faced while creating this game with my co-programmer [Enrique](https://enriquecmarcelo.github.io/).



<br>
As I was tasked to handle the lobby match making, I had quite a tough and interesting time understanding the lobby and room logic with the new perspective of multiple clients and master client.


<br>
However, it was interesting enough for me to want to learn more multiplayer networking coding for making future multiplayer games.

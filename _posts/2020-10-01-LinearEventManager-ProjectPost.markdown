## Description
***
<br>
Linear Effect Manager 2 (LEM 2) is the second iteration of [LEM 1](https://github.com/bestcolour/Linear-Event-Manager). LEM 2 is a node editor tool created in Unity and C# that makes blocks of code ,which executes an effect, easy to plan and reuse. This is specially useful for Tutorial events or UI transition events.
<br>
<br>



## Features
----
<br>
- Modular and Reusable Code
- Effects are highly customisable
- Effects code can be self-optimized
- Visual Programming
- Open Source

<br>
Back in Year 2's [Hangry Guardians]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/polytechnic-games/hangryguardian-post) project, I was coding the tutorial for the beginner levels and I hesitated at the idea of coding each tutorial levels manually. There, I made a prototype Tutorial Event Manager script which allowed me to modularize certain blocks of code which did certain things in a linear order.

<br>

Seeing how unoptimized and ugly it was, I took it upon myself to learn to make it into a node editor and wanted to use it in my next project.

<br>
LEM 1 was more or less completed on June of 2020 where I learnt design patterns like the Command Pattern and how to write a custom Unity's EditorWindow class.



<br>
However, that was not enough, LEM 1 was still unoptimized and hard to add custom code thus making it hard for me to use in a project where I may need to write custom effects.




<br>

Thus, I started my second iteration of LEM on September 2020 and completed it more or less on October 2020 where I made the node blocks more organized and simple to reuse and customize its code.

## The High-Level Overview
<br>
The Goal: To create a remote controllable car that can move in 4 directions and its remote with 2 Raspberry Picos.

<br>

Responsibilities: Embedded Systems Developer & Tester

<br>

**Key Contributions:**
- Architected a Finite State Machine (FSM)
- Fine-tuned Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
- Developed Ultrasound Sensor Feature

<br>
<br>

**Tech Stack:**

<br>

Language - C

<br>

Tools & Packages - CMake, FreeRTOS, Arduino

<br>

4. Key Features & Functionality

Don't just list features; explain the value they provide.

    Feature A: How it works + why it’s useful.

    Feature B: How it works + why it’s useful.

5. Technical Challenges & Solutions

This is the most important section. It proves you can handle adversity.

    The Hurdle: Describe a specific bug, scaling issue, or architectural roadblock.

    The Fix: How did you research it? What logic did you use to solve it?

    The Lesson: What did this teach you about your stack or workflow?

6. Results & Reflections

Numbers speak louder than code.

    Metrics (if applicable): "Reduced load time by 30%" or "Automated a process that took 5 hours weekly."

    Final Thoughts: What would you do differently in Version 2.0? This shows a "growth mindset."
